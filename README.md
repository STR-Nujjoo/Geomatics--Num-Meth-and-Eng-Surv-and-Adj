# GEOMATICS: Numerical Methods & Engineering Surveying and Adjustment
This work, primarily in the surveying industry, has a solid mathematical and statistical foundation for handling and adjusting extremely precise measurements. Still, these bases can be expanded to cover any application involving accurate measurement, such as geodesy and LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM) fittings.

The problems were solved in the R and Python programming languages and dealt with the law of propagation of variances, least squares techniques, and coordinate transformations. Furthermore, where necessary, supporting documents containing justifications and derivations were supplied explicitly.

Most of the problems and written solutions can be found in [*Ogundare, J.O., 2018. Understanding least squares estimation and geomatics data analysis. John Wiley & Sons*](https://books.google.co.za/books?id=hn9xDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA13&ots=nqrk_IMUqm&dq=Understanding%20Least%20Squares%20Estimation%20and%20Geomatics%20Data%20Analysis&lr&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=Understanding%20Least%20Squares%20Estimation%20and%20Geomatics%20Data%20Analysis&f=false).
